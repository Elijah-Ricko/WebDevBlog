  <p>This blog post is showing a way to use timeouts as a recursive call. This is also using an object called Date(). Using setTimeout(), the function being sent to it is actually the function that it is in. So basically, it's a delayed recursive call. By setting the time to 1000, it refreshes the time every second like a clock.</p>

  <pre>
  function showTime() {
    var date = new Date();
    var h = date.getHours(); // 0 - 23
    var m = date.getMinutes(); // 0 - 59
    var s = date.getSeconds(); // 0 - 59
    .
    .
    .
    var time = h + ":" + m + ":" + s + " " + session;
    document.getElementById("MyClockDisplay").innerText = time;
    
    setTimeout(showTime, 1000);
  }
  </pre>

  <p>This is a very simple but really fun way to create a clock. It's not too complicated and is very similar to how it could be done in other languages.</p>
