    <h1>Blog 10</h1>

    <p>For this blog, I'll be focuing on getting a better understanding of using multiple dispatches. As I'm going through project3, I found myself needing more to be done at a given point. For my needs, I wanted to display a message to the user dependent on if the a fetch call was successful or not. AND if it was successful, I wanted to change the state of some data in the global store. Below, I'll show what I came up with.</p>

    <pre>
    if (data.ok) {
      dispatch(updateID({
        ...expense,
        id: id,
      }));
    
      dispatch(changeMessage("Successful"));
    
    } else {
      dispatch(changeMessage("Invalid"));
    }
  </pre>

    <p>This is nothing too complicated, but I did not have this initial understanding of dispatch's usability. I will be doing a few more things like this when I implement asynchronous activity as well.</p>
