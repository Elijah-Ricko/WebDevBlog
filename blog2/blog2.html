      Tutorial
    </a>

    <p>This week I found a Youtube video by Kevin Powell on creating a typewriter animation. This involved learning
      features like "::before", "::after", "@keyframes". ::before and ::after are pseudo-elements that lie before and
      after the element its attached to. @keyframes essentially defines one or many moments in an animation. When you
      call it with animation:, the moments in between are filled in gradually.</p>

    <pre>
@keyframes typewriter {
  to { left: 100% }
}
    </pre>

    <p>This keyframe will move the left edge of the attribute 100% to the right.</p>

    <pre>
@keyframes blink {

  0% { opactiy: 100; }
  49.9% { opacity: 100}

  50% { opacity: 0; }
  100% { opacity: 0; }

}
    </pre>

    <p>This keyframe is for making the cursor blink. Since keyframes are filled in gradually when animated, I had to
      define that no change should happen between 0-49% and 50-100%.</p>

    <pre>
.text::before {
  background-color: tan;
  animation: typewriter 5s steps(25) 2s forwards;
}
    </pre>

    <p>This creates a ::before pseudo-element before (to the left of) the text being animated. In a different area, I
      stretched this element to be the width of the text. The color is tan matching the background color, thus making
      the text "invisible". Here, the animation calls typewriter, waits 2 seconds, steps through the animation 25 steps
      (the length of the text), and lasts 5 seconds.</p>

    <pre>
.text::after {
  width: 0.05em;
  background: black;
    
  animation:
    typewriter 5s steps(25) 2s forwards,
    blink 1000ms steps(25) infinite;
}
    </pre>

    <p>This ::after element is made thin and black to resemble a cursor.  the animation calls both @keyframes. typewriter makes the cursor move with the tan block making it appear as if the text comes from the cursor. blink helps resemble a real cursor constantly blinking.</p>
