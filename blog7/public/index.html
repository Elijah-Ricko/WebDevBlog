    <p>In this blog, I attempted to have images of lily pads display all around the screen in random locations. I achieved it, but since I'm using React, I'm currently unsure as to how to make it appear in the html file. All of my React files I made to achieve are pushed though. So, here I'll explain it how I normally would.</p>

    <p>In this blog, I further worked on what we learned in class. I created a component called 'Pad' that is one instance of the many lily pads floating around the sreen. One new thing I added to this is that every time you refresh the page, the lily pads change location on the screen. Below I will provide the code snippets that made this possible.</p>

    <pre>          
      import image from './lily-pad.png';
      import React, {useRef} from 'react';
    
        export function Pad() {
    
          const styles = useRef({
            position: 'absolute',
            top: Math.floor(Math.random() * 600),
            left: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1300),
          });
    
          return (
            &ltimg src={image} className="image" alt="lily pad"
              width="150" height="auto" style={styles.current} /&gt
          );
    
        }    
    </pre>

    <p>The extent of figuring out how to do this was learned from
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63525812/react-random-position-every-time-the-same-picture-renders" target="_blank">Here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>I also figured out how to use 'pre' from
