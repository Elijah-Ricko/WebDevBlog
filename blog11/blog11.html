    <h1>Blog 11</h1>

    <p>If I were to teach this class, I would definitely still teach the same topics in the same order. I think the basis of HTML->CSS->JavaScript->React worked very well. I would like to add some more in class discussion/walkthroughs though. Maybe not every single class, but maybe 1-2 at the beginning of each stage.</p>

    <p>The daily lab structure felt like a very good way to get a handle on each lanuage. So, I would definitely keep that aspect of the class. One slight modification to that would be to have some way to keep track of who has a question and the order they raised there hand (e.g. write your name on the board, maybe a website that students can each add their name to the list). I found it to be difficult to continue working while making sure my hand was still raised.</p>

    <p>Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed the style of this class. Each assignment served a purpose, and I felt like I learned a lot of valuable lessons.</p>
